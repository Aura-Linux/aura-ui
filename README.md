# aura-ui
This is the web management UI for Aura. It is written in PHP and is designed to manage the Linux side of Aura from 
within the Mac environment.

It is intentionally left as simple HTML with little styling to allow for speed and compatibility for the relatively 
limited browsers in the Mac environment.
